# state_machine Project

## Introduction / Strategy

https://www.chipverify.com/verilog/verilog-fsm

This project will provide a skeleton for a Moore state machine.

* Moore State Machine - Output determined by current state (outputs are connected to the states)
* Mealy State Machine - Output determined by current state and input (outputs are connected to the transitions between states)

For Moore StateMachines, you need 

* next state logic - applies the next state and makes it the current state, every clock tick, sensitivity list contains the clock
* input / output processing / output logic - receives a letter from the alphabet as input, performs output and set the next state into the next_state variable.
* registers that hold the current state - have to have enough with to store all states
* a list of states - states may be defined as parameters

The constraint that the design has to deal with is the fact that a variable can only be modified by
a single always block! This is why two variables are used: cur_state and next_state instead of just one state machine state variable.
The next state logic modifies cur_state whereas the output logic modifies next_state.
By changing next_state, a state transition request is issued. The requset is not executed by the next state logic immediately
but only with the next clock tick. The next state logic copies next_state into cur_state and therefore executes the state transition.

The "next state logic" is sequential (sensitivity list contains the clock)

```
always @(posedge clk) 
begin

  // if reset is asserted, go back to IDLE state
  if (!resetn) 
  begin
    cur_state <= IDLE;
  end

  // else transition to the next state
  else begin
    cur_state <= next_state;
  end
  
end
```

The "output logic" is triggered when the state changes.

```
// Combinational always block for next state logic
always @(*) 
begin
    
  // Default next state assignment
  next_state = IDLE;

  case (cur_state)
  
    IDLE: begin
	  // process input in IDLE state
      if (input_signal)
	    next_state = STATE_1; // Transition to STATE_1 on input_signal
	end

    STATE_1: begin
	  // process input in STATE_1 state
      if (!input_signal)
        next_state = STATE_2; // Transition to STATE_2 if input_signal is low
    end

    STATE_2:  
	  next_state = IDLE; // Transition back to IDLE
        
	default:  
	  next_state = IDLE; // Fallback to default state
    
  endcase
  
end
```

As input signals, this project will use a button press.
As outputs, this project will light a different LED per state.

```
// the state machine that runs the demo application has three states: IDLE, SEND and WAIT
//
// IDLE is entered on reset. IDLE immediately transitions to SEND.
// IDLE does not perform any action.
//
// SEND is entered after IDLE and when the wait period is over.
// During SEND a string of DATA_NUM characters is transmitted, one
// character per clock tick. Once all characters are transmitted,
// the transition to WAIT takes place because the demo wants to 
// wait around for some time before sending DATA_NUM characters again.
//
// In WAIT, the system remains still whithout sending data for one
// second. WAIT is the only state, where the system checks for incoming data.
// If a byte is received, that exact byte is immediately sent out over the tx line.

## UART RX

The RX UART module first computes how many clock ticks pass per character appearing on the RX line.
The amount of ticks per character depend on the selected baudrate which is 115200 in the example and
on the clock frequency which is 27 Mhz in this example. The localparam CYCLE stores the computed clock 
ticks per character bit.

Then the RX line is sampled. In the middle, after CYCLE / 2 samples, the sampled value is used as the
actual value of that bit.

When all bits for a character have been sampled, a character has been received.

# Dual-Purpose PIN

Project > Configuration > Place & Route > Dual-Purpose Pin > Check "Use DONE as regular IO"

# Building

Next, we need to go through the build steps: 
Validate, Synthesize, Place and Route, Build Bit File, Load to FPGA.

## Synthesis

In the GOWIN IDE, open the "Process" tab > On the "Synthesis" node, open the context menu > Run.

Open the "Console" tab at the very bottom.
If the synthesis completes succesfully, you will get a line of output in the console:

```
GowinSynthesis finish
```
and on top of that line, on the "Message" tab, there should be 0 errors! 
Otherwise synthesis failed!

## Constraints

Can only be done once synthesis succeeded.

For our code to actually do anything, we must bind the ports we defined to the actual pins of the FPGA chip.

Double click the FloorPlanner in the Process interface to set pin constraints.

Let the IDE create a default constraints file.
"This project doesn't include CST file (*.cst), do you want to create a default one?" > OK

A "FloorPlanner" windows opens up.

Go to the "I/O Constraints" tab.

You need to enter the following information:

See: https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/examples/led.html


| Port		| Direction		| Location 		| I/O Type |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| led[0]    | output		| 10			| LVCMOS18 |
| led[1]	| output		| 11			| LVCMOS18 |
| led[2]	| output		| 13			| LVCMOS18 |
| led[3]	| output		| 14			| LVCMOS18 |
| led[4]	| output		| 15			| LVCMOS18 |
| led[5]	| output		| 16			| LVCMOS18 |
| uart_tx   | output        | 17			| LVCMOS33 |
| uart_rx   | input        	| 18			| LVCMOS33 |
| sys_clk   | input			| 52			| LVCMOS33 | 
| sys_rst_n | input			| 4             | LVCMOS18 |

sys_clk has to be input and LVCMOS33. sys_rst_n has to be input. The UART pins are both LVCMOS33.


Save the file and close the FloorPlanner.


## Timing Constraints

In the tree on the left, double click User Constraints > Timing Constraints Editor.
"This project doesn't include SDC file (*.sdc), do you want to create a default one?" > OK

In the tree, select the node "Clocks" > In the right editor view, open the context menu and select: Create Clock

Clock name: sys_clk
Frequency: 27 MHz
Objects: [get_ports {sys_clk}]


## Place and Route

Next, open the context menu on "Place and Route" > Run.
In the tree view on the left side, the icon on the "Place & Route" node will turn into a green check icon.

HINT: Once Place and Route is done, the bitfile has been created and can immediately be uploaded using the programmer!
There is no explicit step to create the bit stream!

## Programmer

Select the programmer button from the toolbar!









# Warning: 'sys_clk' was determined to be a clock but was not created.

During Place & Route, the system outputs the following warning:

```
WARN  (TA1132) :  'sys_clk' was determined to be a clock but was not created.
```

https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/Nano-9K.html

Solution:
In order to make this warning go away, you need to add a Timing Constraints file (*.sdc)
that adds standard constraints (27 Mhz and also correct PIN) for the default sys_clk.
To see how to do this, check the section "Timing Constraints" in this document.
